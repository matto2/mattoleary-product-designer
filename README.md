Hello!

I'm a Senior Product Designer with a demonstrated history of increasing the usability of digital products. Skilled in user flows, rapid prototyping, accessibility, and final design and specs. Passionate about continuous discovery and iterating for the benefit of customer and business goals. 

For the last 10+ years I have worked for enterprise software companies- solving problems for customers. Prior to that I worked at a couple design agencies as well as West Marine. I consider myself a design generalist with my best skill being observation, listening and iterating based on feedback.

Sincerely, 
Matt Oâ€™Leary
