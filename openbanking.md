<p>The Open Banking demo site was kind of like a side project within the greater Axway org. It was created by a small, collaborative, and cross-functional team led by Eyal Sivan (Mr Open Banking) and I was tapped to be the designer. The site features real APIs but with a made-up, representative bank.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>

<p>Out of the 5 banks that have had a personal demo so far, all of them have signed up for an Open Banking Proof-of-Concept engagement with Axway. They are using the front and back end that we built (but they'll be adding their own bank name and branding).</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeM6cRA4hBA">demo showing the open banking reference site in action</a>
